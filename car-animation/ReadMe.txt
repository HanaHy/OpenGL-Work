Code for reading in obj files used from SmartSite HelloHouse.cpp
Code for track/scenery set up and chassis: http://cglabprojects.blogspot.in/2014/03/racing-car-in-racing-track.html
Theme/idea borrowed from MarioKart & Super Mario Galaxy.
Makefile from SmartSite.

What I did: Added in the Luma stars, made a Luma a driver, made a rainbow road aka the track (like Mario Kart!), added light sources, placed
a timer function to update views/position - gets called every 2000 ms (2 sec), changed movement of car, added viewing positions.
